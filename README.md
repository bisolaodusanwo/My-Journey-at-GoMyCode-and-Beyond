My Journey at GoMyCode and Beyond

 Introduction
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  
Iâ€™m Bisola Odusanwo, a passionate full-stack developer focusing on the MERN stack. When I started this journey, I dealt with a lot of self-doubt and imposter syndrome, but thanks to the incredible support from my mentors, friends, and loved ones, Iâ€™ve grown in ways I never imagined. This README tells my story, how I grew as a developer, the projects Iâ€™ve worked on, and the amazing people who made it all possible.

 The GoMyCode Experience
My time at GoMyCode was a mix of growth and challenges. Early on, I struggled with feeling like my work wasnâ€™t good enough, but that all changed thanks to Usman Oni, my instructor. He was more than just a mentor, he was the driving force behind my development. Usman always believed in me, even when I doubted myself. His tough love was exactly what I needed. I vividly remember one weekend when I was trying to handle a group project by myself instead of working with my team. Usman didnâ€™t let me off easy, he pushed me to collaborate, taught me how to handle pull requests, merge code, and truly work as a team. That was one of the hardest lessons, but it completely transformed how I approach my work.

During this time, I also had the chance to learn from Deji Atanda (Ice). He wasnâ€™t my official instructor, but he was always willing to help out. Dejiâ€™s morning classes were full of insight, and he didnâ€™t hesitate to explain complex concepts, debug issues, or share resources like Figma designs and YouTube videos. His openness and willingness to go the extra mile helped me improve my skills outside of the structured lessons.


Projects Iâ€™ve Built

Here are a few of the projects Iâ€™m most proud of:

1. Real Estate Marketplace

Tech Stack: React, Node.js, MongoDB, Cloudinary, AWS S3, JWT  
This full-stack real estate marketplace allows users to browse and manage property listings. I integrated the Google Maps API for location-based searches and AWS for secure media storage. This project pushed me to think about scalability, security, and user experience in a comprehensive way.

2. Next.js Dashboard

Tech Stack: Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS  
This project involved building a user-friendly interactive dashboard using Next.js and TypeScript. It taught me how to manage complex state and data visualization effectively, and Iâ€™m proud of how intuitive and clean the interface turned out.

3. Task Manager Web Application

Tech Stack: React.js, TailwindCSS, Node.js, MongoDB  
Working with a team of developers, we created a task management system aimed at improving team productivity. I contributed to both front-end and back-end development, implementing user authentication and task tracking features.

4. Todo-List-ReactJS

Tech Stack: React.js, CSS  
A simple yet effective to-do list app that helped me sharpen my front-end skills. This project is a perfect example of how every build, no matter the complexity, plays a part in growth.

- Overcoming Imposter Syndrome

Imposter syndrome was a constant struggle for me in the beginning. I hesitated to push projects to GitHub because I felt like they werenâ€™t significant enough. But through Usman Oniâ€™s guidance and the support from my colleagues, I started seeing my work differently. Every project, big or small, is part of my growth as a developer. With time, I began sharing more and taking pride in the progress I was making, embracing the fact that learning is a continual process.


 Acknowledgments

I canâ€™t begin to express how grateful I am to Alex Taiwo, whose support was absolutely essential throughout this journey. Alex wasnâ€™t just a sounding boardâ€”he was actively involved in helping me grow. Whether it was sending me YouTube tutorials, giving me advice, or even putting his own work on hold to explain things I didnâ€™t understand, Alex was always there. He saw potential in me when I struggled to see it myself, and his belief in me made all the difference. There were countless late nights where Alexâ€™s patience and encouragement kept me going. I truly wouldnâ€™t have made it this far without his constant support.

Of course, I have to give a huge thanks to Usman Oni, my instructor at GoMyCode. Usman wasnâ€™t just teaching me how to code; he was teaching me how to push past my comfort zones. His firm but fair approach taught me the value of teamwork, collaboration, and thorough problem-solving. Usman didnâ€™t accept excuses, and Iâ€™m so thankful for that. When I look back on my journey, his guidance stands out as one of the most critical factors in my growth as a developer.

And to Deji Atanda (Ice), thank you for all the extra help and insights. You were always ready to share knowledge and go beyond the regular lessons. The extra Figma designs, YouTube videos, and code debugging sessions were so helpful in my development, and I truly appreciate the time you took to guide me.

Lastly, a big thank you to my colleagues. Working alongside such talented and supportive people made every challenge easier and every success even more rewarding. We learned so much from each other, and Iâ€™m excited for what the future holds for us all.

 Conclusion
From feeling like I wasnâ€™t good enough to now confidently sharing my work, my journey at GoMyCode has been filled with growth, challenges, and immense support. Iâ€™m excited to continue building, learning, and contributing to the developer community. Thank you for taking the time to read my story!
